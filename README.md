Welcome to WeatherApp, a JavaFX project that allows users to search for cities and obtain detailed weather information along with related GIFs. This application utilizes two APIs: WeatherApi for weather data and Giphy API for fetching GIFs related to the weather conditions.

## Features

- **City Search**: Users can search for cities by name to retrieve a list of matching cities.

- **Weather Information**: Upon selecting a specific city from the list, the application fetches real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and air quality.

- **GIF Display**: WeatherApp provides a related GIF based on the current weather conditions to make the experience more engaging and visually appealing.
